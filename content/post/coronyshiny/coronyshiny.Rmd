###Covid-19 

If I had a nickel for every time I've had to say "these are unprecendeted circumstances" in the past few weeks, I would have quite a few. Shelter at home has people going crazy, myself included. 
  
  
Anyway, I decided to create a shiny dashboard app to visualise corona spreading trends. These visualisations can be super useful in understanding how to model pandemics. I've left the code here. I used the shiny website to deploy the app.

###Data Source

While a lot of news out;ets and government sources have their own configuration of corona data, I decided to use the open-srouce data provided by https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus . The interactive graphs they have are wayy more cooler than mine. But hey, you gotta start somewhere.

<h3>Covid-19</h3>
<p>If I had a nickel for every time I've had to say &quot;these are unprecendeted circumstances&quot; in the past few weeks, I would have quite a few. Shelter at home has people going crazy, myself included.</p>
<p>Anyway, I decided to create a shiny dashboard app to visualise corona spreading trends. These visualisations can be super useful in understanding how to model pandemics. I've left the code here. I used the shiny website to deploy the app.</p>

<h3>Data Source</h3>
<p>While a lot of news out;ets and government sources have their own configuration of corona data, I decided to use the open-srouce data provided by <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus" class="uri">https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus</a> . The interactive graphs they have are wayy more cooler than mine. But hey, you gotta start somewhere.</p>
